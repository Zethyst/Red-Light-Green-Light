<h1 align="center">Python Squid Game: Red Light, Green Light Simulator with OpenCV</h1>
<p>This Python program uses OpenCV and computer vision techniques to track a user's movements and simulate the 'Red Light, Green Light' game from the popular Netflix series 'Squid Game'. The program constantly shuffles between green and red lights, and the user must freeze their movement when the light turns red to avoid being eliminated. The program includes graphics and interactivity for a fun and engaging gaming experience. Give it a try and see if you have what it takes to survive the game!"</p>
